# Android GameLoop for 2D Games

For a detailed walkthrough of the game loop and other components, please refer to the `GamePanel.java` document available in this repository.

## Overview

This repository provides a basic implementation of a game loop for Android 2D games. The game loop, a fundamental component of most video games, ensures the smooth flow and timing of a game's progress. This project aims to offer an easily adaptable game loop template that can be modified to suit different 2D game requirements.

## Getting Started

The game loop comprises of four main steps: updating the game state, rendering the new state, sleeping until the next update, and repeating the loop. The updating and rendering processes are performed in separate threads to maximize efficiency and responsiveness.

## Structure of the Game Loop

- **Initialization**: This stage sets up the necessary game objects and variables before the loop starts.
- **Updating the Game State**: The game state is updated according to the input received and the elapsed time since the last update.
- **Rendering the Game State**: The current state of the game is then drawn onto the screen.
- **Sleeping**: The thread sleeps for a specified time to control the game's speed and responsiveness.
- **Repeat**: The loop is repeated, starting with the update of the game state.
